# django-reversion-hvad
Hacky snippet for django-reversion to allow work with TranslatableModel by hvad

If you got `TranslatableModel` created with hvad, this snippet should allow you to generate history of translatable model
Notice this; the template only comes from my project, maybe you should create your own templates 

Work's for me on django-reversion: `django-reversion==1.8.5`
